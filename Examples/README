This directory contains examples/tests for GNUstep Renaissance.  Often
these examples/tests create complex/messy objects/relationships
between the objects, or use unportable tricks, for testing purposes.
You shouldn't necessary take them all as good examples of how to write
good gsmarkup files in applications.

TODO: Separate 'examples' from 'tests'.


To run these examples, you need to use GSMarkupBrowser.app (found
in Tools/).  I typically install GSMarkupBrowser.app, then type

openapp GSMarkupBrowser box

to view the box.gsmarkup example.
