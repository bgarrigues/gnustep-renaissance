This directory contains Template applications.

A 'Template' application is an application which compiles, and starts
up (including menus), but does nothing.

It is meant as a starting point for writing new applications: when you
write your own new application, you can start from a 'Template'
application, rather than from scratch.

The Templates are public domain.  You can use them as a starting point
to write any sort of application with any sort of copyright you like.

The following Templates are available:

- Standard: provides a template for a 'Standard' application.
Contains a main menu with all standard menu items.  To use the
'Standard' template:

 * copy the template files in your application directory;

 * rename MyApplicationInfo.plist to XxxxInfo.plist, where Xxxx is your
   application's name;

 * edit XxxxInfo.plist adding all details (name, short description, author etc)
   of your application.

 * edit GNUmakefile replacing MyApplication with your application's name;

 * remove menu items/menus your application doesn't need from the menus;
   add the ones it needs.

 * start writing your application from MainController.h,
   MainController.m and MainWindow.gsmarkup.


- DocumentBased: provides a template for a 'NSDocument-based'
application.  Contains a main menu with all possible standard menu
items for a document based application, and a NSDocument subclass
placeholder. (TODO)
