This example shows how to programmatically redo the layout of a simple
window if you need.

In the example, we create a switch button, and then, after loading the
gsmarkup file, we programmatically change the title of the button and
redo the entire autolayout of the window programmatically.

The interesting code is in main.m, [AutoLayoutUpdateExample -awakeFromGSMarkup].

Thanks
