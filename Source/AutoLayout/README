The AutoLayout part of Renaissance is still under heavy construction :-)

The internals (including class hierarchy!) are still subject to changes.

What shouldn't change -- at least, not too much :-) -- is what is
declared in the headers NSView.h, GSAutoLayoutDefaults.h, and GSBox.h
(which is the main API of GSHBox and GSVBox).

Everything else (including the internals of GSHBox and GSVBox, and
their position in the class hierarchy) is subject to change without
notice.
