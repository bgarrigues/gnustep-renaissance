/*
 * This is the grid; it uses two autolayout managers, one for the rows
 * and one for the columns.  In other words, you can imagine a table
 * with rows and columns; every view in the grid is exactly positioned
 * in a cell of the table at a specified row and column.
 *
 * The 'span' is supported, representing views that take up multiple
 * rows or multiple columns.
 *
 * If the autolayout manager used for rows (or columns) is a
 * proportional one, the proportion is supported, representing rows
 * (or columns) that take up proportionally more space.
 *
 * The column autolayout manager decides on the size of each column.
 * A "line" of the column autolayout manager is a row of the grid.
 *
 * The row autolayout manager decides on the size of each row.  A
 * "line" of the row autolayout manager is a column of the grid.
