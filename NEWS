Changes in version `0.9.0'

  * Rewritten the autolayout managers and boxes; finalized the
    autolayout attributes

    debugging) by making it exact and not approximate

    consistently in the GSAutoLayout namespace.

  * Fixed memory leaks and various bugs.

  * Ported to Windows (via GNUstep).

  * Ported to Apple Mac OS X 10.5.

    hardcoded sizes

  * Fixed embedding boxes in splitviews.

  * Made it possible to compile and use Markup as a standalone non-GUI
    library.

  * Added support for escaping '#' in attributes.
  
  * Use precompiled headers to speed up compilation on GNUstep.

  * Tidied up alloc/init methods of GSMarkupTagObject.

  * Fixed setting autolayout flags for views directly embedded into an
    NSBox.

  * Extended warnings for errors in gsmarkup files such as
    non-existing actions.

XML Format Changes in version `0.9.0'
=====================================

This is a 0.x release so the XML tags and attributes are still subject
to some minor changes while we work towards a 1.0.0 release.

 * the 'align' attribute of the <label> and <textField> class has been
   renamed to 'textAlignment'.  The 'alignment' attribute of <image>
   has been renamed to 'imageAlignment'.  'textAlignment' and 'font'
   have been made more widely available in all controls with
   consistent names and no conflicts.

 * the 'color' attribute of <label> has been changed to 'textColor' to
   be consistent with attributes used in other tags.

 * the 'key' attribute of <button>, <menuItem> and <popUpButtonItem>
   has been changed to 'keyEquivalent' to be consistent with other
   attributes.

 * the 'span' attribute of <hbox> and <vbox> has been replaced by a
   'proportion' attribute.

 * the proportional boxes no longer automatically expand all the
   views.  Make sure you specify the alignment flags you want for each
   view.
