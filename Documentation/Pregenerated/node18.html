2.4 The connectors section</A>
</H1>

<P>
The connectors section is used to establish connections between
objects.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00341000000000000000">
2.4.1 How objects are given ids</A>
</H2>
Objects are identified by their <TT>id</TT>.  There are various ways
in which an object can be given an <TT>id</TT>:

<UL>
<LI>Objects created by the file are given an id if the tags which
  creates them contains the <TT>id</TT> attribute.  For example,
<PRE>
&lt;textField id="pop3" width="200" /&gt;
</PRE>
  the textField object is given the <TT>id</TT> <TT>pop3</TT>.
</LI>
<LI>The file owner - an object which is specified by the code
  loading the GSMarkup file, and normally is the main way of
  connecting objects in the GSMarkup file with the rest of the
  application - is automatically given the <TT>id</TT>
  <TT>NSOwner</TT>.
</LI>
<LI>Additional objects which the code loading the GSMarkup file
  wants to make available to the GSMarkup file.  By specifying an
  external name table when loading the GSMarkup file, the code can
  give an <TT>id</TT> to any existing object in the application (and
  so making it available for establishing connections to/from it).
</LI>
<LI>Some predefined objects have a predefined <TT>id</TT> given to
  them automatically by the system.  For example, the main
  <TT>NSApplication</TT> instance is automatically available with
  <TT>id</TT> <TT>NSApp</TT>.
</LI>
</UL>
Any object which has been given an id can be the source or the target
of a connection set up in the connectors section.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00342000000000000000">
2.4.2 Connector tags</A>
</H2>
Inside the connectors section tags are interpreted in a different way
than inside the objects section.  Inside the connectors sections, tags
are interpreted as being connectors tags rather than object tags.
Connector tags might vary, but normally you only need to know about
outlet connectors, so we only describe outlet connectors here.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00343000000000000000">
2.4.3 Outlet connectors</A>
</H2>
An outlet connector is created with the <TT>&lt;outlet&gt;</TT> tag.  For
example,
<PRE>
&lt;connectors&gt;
 &lt;outlet source="#NSOwner" target="#Controller" key="controller" /&gt;
&lt;/connectors&gt;
</PRE>
An outlet has a source (an object specified by id), a target (another
object again specified by id), and a key (a string).  The outlet
describes a connection which should be established between the source
and target object; the key represents a key in the source object.  By
using key-value coding, when the outlet connection is established, the
value for the key in the source is set to the target (I'll try to
explain this better in a minute).  In the example, when the outlet is
established, it's result will likely to be to invoke
<PRE>
[#NSOwner setController: #Controller];
</PRE>
(where <TT>#NSOwner</TT> is the object with id <TT>NSOwner</TT> and 
<TT>#Controller</TT> is the object with id <TT>Controller</TT>).

<P>
As an advanced extension, if the <TT>source</TT> or <TT>target</TT> of
an outlet connector contains a dot (that is, the <TT>'.'</TT> 
character), then the part of the string before the dot is interpreted
as an object specified by id, and the part of the string after the dot
is interpreted as a key value path to use on the object to get the
actual <TT>source</TT> or <TT>target</TT>.  For example, when the outlet
<PRE>
&lt;connectors&gt;
 &lt;outlet source="#NSOwner" target="#Controller.name" key="controllerName" /&gt;
&lt;/connectors&gt;
</PRE>
is established, it's result will likely to be to invoke
<PRE>
[#NSOwner setControllerName: [#Controller name]];
</PRE>
assuming that <TT>#Controller</TT> responds to a method
<TT>name</TT> (if it doesn't, key-value coding - as explained 
in the next section - is used to retrieve the value for key
<TT>name</TT> of the object <TT>#Controller</TT>).

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00344000000000000000">
2.4.4 Details of how outlet connections are established</A>
</H2>
When an outlet connection is established, the following things happen:

<OL>
<LI>the outlet connector determines the source and target objects
  from their ids (by performing a lookup in the name tables which
  store the mappings from ids to objects).  If the ids do not contains
  dots, a simple lookup in the name table is done.  If the source or
  target strings contain a dot, then the advanced key value coding
  support is used: the string is broken in two parts: before and after
  the first dot in the string.  For example,
  <TT>#NSController.delegate.name</TT> would be broken into
  <TT>#NSController</TT> and <TT>delegate.name</TT>.  The first part
  of the string is looked up in the name table, producing an object.
  Then, key value coding is used to retrieve the value for the key
  path given by the second string on this object.  In practice, if the
  first part of the string is <TT>xxx</TT>, and the second part is
  <TT>yyy</TT>, the <TT>source</TT> or <TT>target</TT> is set to the
  result of the following operations:
<PRE>
[[nameTable objectForKey: xxx] valueForKeyPath: yyy];
</PRE>
  (please check the documentation for <TT>valueForKeyPath:</TT> to
learn more about this operation).
</LI>
<LI>the outlet connector calls
<PRE>
[source takeValue: target forKey: key];
</PRE>
  to set target as the value for the key key in the source.  If you
  don't know what this really mean, we describe here briefly what this
  does; for more information please read the documentation of the
  <TT>takeValue:forKey:</TT> method.

<OL>
<LI>if the key is xxx, the system searches for the <TT>setXxx:</TT>
  method in the source (please note that the first letter of xxx is
  made uppercase).  If that method exists, the following code is
  executed:
<PRE>
[source setXxx: target];
</PRE>
  and the outlet connection can be considered established.
</LI>
<LI>if the method wasn't found, the <TT>_setXxx:</TT> method is
  searched, and if it exists is used.
</LI>
<LI>if this fails, the system searches an instance variable with
  name <TT>_xxx</TT> in the source, and if it finds it, it
  <TT>ASSIGN</TT>s to it the target<A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot1361"><SUP>2.3</SUP></A>.  Assigning includes
  releasing the previous value, and retaining the new one.
</LI>
<LI>if the <TT>_xxx</TT> instance variable is not found, the system
  searches for an instance variable called <TT>xxx</TT>, and tries to
  set that.
</LI>
<LI>if even this fails, the system calls the method
  <TT>-handleTakeValue:forUnboundKey:</TT> of the source, which -
  unless overridden by the source class - raises an exception.
</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
</OL>
As you can see, you can automatically set up instance variables of
objects to point to other objects when you load a gsmarkup file.  This is
very handy to establish connections between objects.
