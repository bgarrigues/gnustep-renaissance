1.4 Introduction to basic Renaissance autolayout objects</A>
</H1>
As in most other autolayout toolkits, most of the basic autolayout
objects in Renaissance are logical views which group different objects and
display them in rows, or columns, or tables.  These autolayout views
as often called ``containers'' in the literature.  They are
invisibile, logical objects, which contain other objects, and organize
the contained objects in rows, or columns, or tables, depending on the
type of container.

<P>
In the next few sections we will provide a short description of the
basic Renaissance autolayout objects.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00241000000000000000">
1.4.1 Boxes</A>
</H2>
By far the most common containers are boxes.  Boxes are used to layout
objects in columns, or rows.  A horizontal box can layout objects in a
row; a vertical box can layout objects in a column.  A box object is
invisible; it is only a logical container which lays out the objects
it contains, and can be placed in a window wherever you can place a
normal object.  You add objects in a box, and the box automatically
gets bigger to accomodate the objects, and arranges the objects inside
itself to be on a row/column.

<P>
Naturally, boxes are themselves objects, so you can put boxes inside
other boxes.  A window usually contains a complete hierarchy of boxes,
organizing the objects into lines and columns, one into the other one.

<P>
Depending on the logic which the box uses to lay out the objects, it
can be of a different type.  In Renaissance, there are two basic types of
boxes: a ``standard'' box, and a ``proportional'' box.  The standard
box is the one used most often; the proportional box is normally used
only for special effects, when the views contained in the box must be
kept with sizes in specified proportions; a typical example is that of
the ``Cancel'' and ``OK'' buttons in panels, which should be of the
same size (the minimum size of the bigger of the two).  This can be
easily done by using a proportional box rather than a standard box to
layout the buttons (as will be explained in full details later).

<P>
In summary, in Renaissance there are four basic types of boxes:
horizontal standard boxes, horizontal proportional boxes, vertical
standard boxes, and vertical proportional boxes.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00242000000000000000">
1.4.2 Grids</A>
</H2>
A grid is a container, which can layout its objects as if they were in
an invisible table.  Grids are more complex and rarer than boxes;
still, there are cases where the layout can be done using a grid, but
can't be done with boxes, no matter how many.

<P>
A grid organizes the views it contains into rows and columns; a box
itself can be considered a grid with a single row (horizontal box) or
a single column (vertical box).

<P>
TODO: talk more about grids

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00243000000000000000">
1.4.3 Spaces</A>
</H2>
Spaces are not containers - they are invisible views, with a minimum
initial size of zero.  When more space is available, the spaces
expand, thus consuming space and creating areas of empty space in the
window, normally for alignment purposes.  They can be needed in some
cases, to control where the alignment or paddings or spacing of other
objects.  You can put a space wherever you can put any other view.
