1.2 Why using the Renaissance AutoLayout support?</A>
</H1>
The Renaissance AutoLayout package provides many advantages over
hard-coding the size and position of objects at compile time (as it is
done traditionally in NeXTstep NIB files):

<OL>
<LI>the package can automatically adjust the layout for the different 
sizes of objects on different platforms or under different themes:
objects such as popup buttons have different sizes on GNUstep and on
Apple OSX, so hardcoding the size and position of popup buttons
creates user interfaces which are not portable between the two
systems: a popup button which is perfectly sized on Apple OSX might be
too tiny on GNUstep, and vice versa; as a matter of fact,
traditionally, you need to write separate user interfaces, with
hardcoded different sizes and positions, for the different systems.
</LI>
<LI>the package can automatically adjust the layout for the different
sizes of objects when the strings displayed in the objects are
translated into another language.  Objects such as buttons, if sized
for the string in the original language, might be too small (or too
big) to display the string when translated into another language.
This is a basic problem of NIB files: if you use NIB files, you need
to create a separate NIB file for each language in which you want to
translate the user interface.
</LI>
<LI>the package can automatically adjust the layout if objects are added
or removed from the window.
</LI>
<LI>the package can automatically setup intelligent autorelayout 
behaviour of the objects, with minimum manual intervention from the
programmer.  Too much software has windows with inconsistent,
inaccurate or even meaningless behaviour under resizing.  The reason
is that checking and testing all the autoresizing flags and masks and
setup is a boring and stupid task, which most programmers would
happily avoid doing.  Renaissance AutoLayout will do it for you whenever
you are in a hurry; of course, you can still override manually any of
Renaissance's choices about autolayout whenever you need, and you will
probably need to give Renaissance a few simple align hints (center, left,
right) to make complex windows pretty.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
In comparison with other similar packages available for other
toolkits, Renaissance is at its best when dealing with ``standard''
windows.  Other toolkits usually provide you with tons of options for
the layout of each widget (or set of widgets), and you actually need
to understand and set a lot of those options (border, padding, expand,
fill, pack ...) just to get a standard window to layout correctly.
Programmers then have to continuously lookup in reference manuals the
meaning of most options, and they often enough forget to set some of
the options, ending up with software where the logic of the software
works, but widgets are laid out with slightly irregulars or
inconsistent layouts, often with irregular and inconsistent borders or
alignments or autolayout behaviours.

<P>
At a more accurate examination, it is found out that most windows of
most software are actually similar and display very similar layout
patterns, and that there is a precise, mechanical logic which can be
used to get most autolayout options right.  Renaissance does its best to
use logic and intelligence to get the autolayout options right for
you, freeing you from the burden of setting manually all the
autolayout options, and allowing you to build a better interface for
your software, and much faster.
