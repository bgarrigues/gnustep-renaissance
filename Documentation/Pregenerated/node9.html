1.7 Expanding views over their minimum size</A>
</H1>

<P>
Some views display information, and once they are of the minimum size
required to display the information, making them bigger does not show
any more information.  A typical example is a fixed text label, or a
button with written 'Cancel', or a button with an image of fixed size.
If all the window were made of such views, once the window is laid
out, there would be no reason to make the window resizable.  All the
information is displayed comfortably on the window in the minimum
size, and more space on the window would help in no way, except mess
up the layout.

<P>
Other views display information, but if they are made bigger, they
benefit from it and can use the new space to display more information.
A typical example is an editable text field, where the user can insert
a string of arbitrary length.  When the window is automatically
created, the text field is of some arbitrary, predermined, length.  If
the user needs to insert more text than the text field can accomodate
at its default size, the user might want to enlarge the text field.
This is normally achieved by making the window resizable, and setting
up the autolayout in such a way that if the user makes the window
bigger, the text field is automatically made bigger.

<P>
Finally, often enough sizing a view to its minimum size is enough to
display the information in the view, but it looks pretty ugly in the
context of the other views.  This is true even for views which are
naturally and inherently unresizable; for example, in panels it's
common to display the 'OK' and the 'Cancel' button at the bottom, with
the same size.  Even if the minimum size of the 'OK' and of the
'Cancel' button are different and they are never supposed to be
resized when the window is later resized, it's more aestethically
pleasant to make them of the same size.

<P>
In other cases, views which look nice at their minimum size might
still require alignment to fit nicely in the rest of the window.  If
more space is available, while they are not resized themselves, they
might need the space to be spread intelligently around in order to be
moved into the right position.

<P>
Finally, some views do look nice at their minimum size, but it might
be graphically nice to expand them when the window is expanded over
the minimum size, to keep them in a pleasant relationship with the
other views.
