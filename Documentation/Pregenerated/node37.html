Attributes referring to other objects</A>
</H3>
In the previous section we have explained how you can tag an object
with an id.  In this section we learn how you can refer to an object
by id.  There is a very general syntax which can be used to refer to
an object which has been given an id: you prefix the id name with a
hashmark (<TT>#</TT>).  For example, if you create a window and give
it an id of <TT>board</TT>, as in
<PRE>
&lt;window id="board"/&gt;
</PRE>
then you can refer to that window object by using the syntax
<TT>#board</TT>.  <TT>#board</TT> simply means <I>the object whose id name 
is</I> <TT>board</TT>.

<P>
This is normally used to establish connections between objects.  There
are two ways of building connections between objects: one is adding a
connector to a connectors section.  A gsmarkup file can contain one or
more connectors sections, where you can freely build up connections
between objects (and you refer to objects by using their ids and the
syntax just explained).  The other way, the one we learn about here,
is by using attributes which take objects as values.

<P>
Some attributes wants other objects as values.  For example, a window
can have a delegate, and this delegate is an object.  You can specify
the delegate object for a window by using the following syntax:
<PRE>
&lt;window delegate="#myDelegate"&gt;
</PRE>
When this file is loaded in a running application, the attribute 
<TT>delegate</TT> is treated specially.  It is treated specially because
its value begins with a hash (<TT>#</TT>), which means it is a
reference to another object (in the file or even outside the file).
When the file is loaded, the method <TT>setDelegate:</TT> of the
window object will automatically be called, with argument the object
which has id name <TT>myDelegate</TT>.  This object can be 

<OL>
<LI>another object which is created by the file when the file is loaded. 
     In the example, since you can create objects of custom classes in
     the file, you could allocate an instance of a custom class, give
     it the id name <TT>myDelegate</TT>, and then make it the window
     controller.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>the file owner.  The file owner is an existing object in the application 
     which loads the file; whenever the application loads a gsmarkup file,
     it needs to specify a file owner object, which is automatically
     made available to the file with the id name <TT>NSOwner</TT>.
     For example, to make the file owner the delegate of your window,
     you would do
<PRE>
&lt;window delegate="#NSOwner"&gt;
</PRE>
     Normally, all connections between the objects loaded in the file
     and the existing application objects are done through the file
     owner.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>some other existing object in the application which is made available 
     to the file when the file is loaded.  If the application needs
     it, by using the extended NSBundle GSMarkup API, it can make
     available any existing object in the application specifying under
     which name it should be available.  If there is a single object
     to connect, it is simpler to make that object available as file
     owner; if there are more, you can specify them in the external
     name table dictionary (see description of the NSBundle GSMarkup API),
     and then the file can make any connections to those objects by
     referring to them by id, and using the special syntax with the
     hash.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Here is another example -
<PRE>
&lt;window&gt;
  &lt;hbox&gt;
    &lt;button title="yes" id="yes" nextKeyView="#no"/&gt;
    &lt;button title="no" id="no" nextKeyView="#yes"/&gt;
  &lt;/hbox&gt;
&lt;/window&gt;
</PRE>
in this example, a window with two buttons is created.  The first
button has title <TT>yes</TT>, the second one has title <TT>no</TT>.
The first button is given id <TT>yes</TT>, and the second one is given
id <TT>no</TT>.  Then, the nextKeyView attribute of the first button
is set to point to the second one, and the nextKeyView attribute of
the second button is set to point to the first one.  This allows users
to navigate between the buttons using the keyboard - pressing TAB
while the input focus is on an object moves the focus to the
nextKeyView of that object.  In the example, the nextKeyView of the
first button is the second one, and viceversa, so by pressing TAB the
user can move the input focus between the two buttons.
