1.3 The basics of autolayout</A>
</H1>

<P>
Autolayout can be a very complex task.  There are only a few basic
requirements which all autolayout systems must implement:

<OL>
<LI>different objects in the window should not overlap - that is, 
the objects (for example buttons or textviews) should be displayed in
separate areas of the window, and not one over the other one, as that
would make part of one object disappear below the other one.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>each object has - usually - a minimum size needed to display, 
and no object should ever be sized to be smaller than this minimum
size.  For example, a 'Cancel' button should never be made smaller
than the minimum size required to display the 'Cancel' string.  But
even this basic requirement is questioned in some autolayout systems
- there are systems were buttons are allowed to become arbitrary
small (till you can no longer read what they are about, and possibly
not even push them!).  Still, you can get this effect even on systems
supporting a minimum size, by manually setting the minimum size of a
button to zero.  Renaissance AutoLayout does support (and encourage
the use of) minimum sizes.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
In theory, given those two basic requirements, not much more can be
said: there are infinite ways of organizing the (auto)layout of a
window.  After all a window is just a rectangular area, and there are
infinite ways you can layout your buttons and textfields inside this
rectangular area, infinite relationships you may want to establish
between the widths and heights and coordinates of those objects.

<P>
Renaissance provides you with support for some standard ways of organizing
your objects, which should be enough to build most standard windows
used in most software.  But there is always the possibility that you
could want/need to have some different relationships between the sizes
and positions of your objects.  If you are very much keen on
establishing ratios between heights and widths and positions of all
your objects, it's quite possible that you could end up with size and
position constrains which can't be implemented using the standard
Renaissance objects.  In that case, you will need to implement your own
autolayout objects, possibly subclassing or reusing in some other way
standard Renaissance AutoLayout objects to cut down your work.
